                <p class="card-text">
                    We believe that Web Pages need Disruption
                    Frame(s)work is a step towards empowering developers to maximize their productivity while delivering users the maximum features and functionality. We believe that software applications/systems can be broken down into three elements:
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    <ol>
                        <li>User Interface for entering information</li>
                        <li>User Interface for reviewing information</li>
                        <li>Data Processing</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">Most software development efforts are focused on interacting with human beings. Whether it is a mobile app or a business productivity application, humans need to launch them, type information, and submit requests. Users value software for the services it provides them. But more importantly, the ability to add/modify features and functionality will maintain the advantage of the software's value.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Website designs are more akin to publishing documents than an application in the traditional sense. A quick search for 'creating document ms publisher' will lead you to several results that will share with you how a user can create the proper layout of images, texts, and banners. It won't take long to see that web page design is eerily similar. But this is a logical conclusion since the profession that has enveloped website design is 'creative designer.' </p>
                <p class="card-text">The future of websites/web applications is enhancing user's productivity. User's have less and less time to 'Surf' the web with their 'Browser'. For most people, they use the web for shopping, socializing, banking, gaming, spreadsheets, emails, and the list goes on and on. But, before explaining how websites need to change, I want to talk about what we have 'all' witnessed since 2007. In 2007, the iPhone was released and the 'App Store' was created. We have all seen that the fresh landscape for mobile device applications led to the proliferation of 'Apps' not mobile websites.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Websites need to become more like Mobile Apps (for mobile devices) and Operating Systems (for computers). Frame(s)work provides each of these experiences. Additionally, there is a platform built by the creator of Frame(s)work named Biztalks, that provides a guided experience to website content. </p>
                <p class="card-text"><b>Why Choose Frame(s)work?</b></p>
                <p class="card-text">At Frame(s)work, we believe that the current approach to website design no longer applies to the user's needs. Web page design has been a series of hyperlinks to content. Even though 'responsive' frameworks, like Bootstrap, have made it commonplace to have content 'naturally' displayed on the any-sized device, little more has been done to innovate the user experience.</p>
                <p class="card-text">So-called 'Modern' javascript frameworks have created a costly distraction from the 'TRUE' purpose of the web: to facilitate Global Integration of people, products, and ideas. We believe that the world wide web needs to integrate change at the most rapid pace possible. </p>
                <p class="card-text">We believe the tools offered to users, "Web Pages," need to be open. Frameworks/Systems like Angular, React, and Vue create encapsulated programming translated to the languages of the browser: HTML, Javascript, and CSS.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Frame(s)work is designed to provide HTML5 programming directly to the Document Object Model (DOM). Using Frame(s)work, a developer or team of developers can quickly build lightweight, robust web pages/applications; Front to Back. Better than that, developers can throw away deprecated functionality, upgrade user experiences, and implement new user interfaces at a pace not seen since static web pages.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Frame(s)work is the last migration you will ever need since it is designed to be 'plug n play.  </p>
