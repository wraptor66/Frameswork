# Frame(s)work
 
Frame(s)work is a framework for modern software developers. It is designed to make each developer exponentially productive and each application maximally reduced & incredibly extensible. Developing software has become too complicated (not complex, since complexity is required). 

At a time when programming is becoming more and more segmented, Frame(s)work cuts through the layers to reductive unification. Although this statement may seem more ethereal than practical, this mandate is the only one that will consistently reduce code bloat and code rot.
